3. Running the project:
<b>Running Without Webpack:</b>

If you want to run the project without using Webpack, follow these steps:

* Open the src/index.html file.
* Uncomment the line for importing styles. This will allow the browser to directly load the styles from the file.
* Open the src/index.html file in your web browser to preview the result.

<b>Building and Running With Webpack:</b>

If you prefer to build and run the project using Webpack for production or development, follow these steps:

* Keep the line for importing styles commented out in the src/index.html file, as Webpack will manage the style import from index.js.
* In the terminal, navigate to the project folder.
* To build the project in production mode, use the command:
* 
```
npm run build
```

The compiled files will be available in the dist folder.
To start the project in development mode, use the command:

```
npm run dev
```
